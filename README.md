# unraidsetup

I'm running my home machine as a set of virtual machines backed by UnRaid.

Why?
1. I want a windows machine as a daily driver and to play a few games on occasionally
1. I want a linux VM for regularl development
1. I want a linux VM that has gpu access for machine learning
1. I want to have a series of docker containers running in the background for basic services

UnRaid is great at virtualization so I'm going with it.
